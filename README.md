## Project Overview

This project is the frontend component of my Cloud Resume Challenge, hosted on AWS. The setup utilizes a variety of AWS services for the website's infrastructure. Below are the services that make up the frontend architecture:

- **Amazon S3**: 
  - Used to host static website files.
  - Two S3 buckets were created: one for the **root domain** (e.g., `johnnyhuang.dev`) and another for the **subdomain** (`www.johnnyhuang.dev`). The root domain bucket is configured to redirect requests to the subdomain, ensuring consistency and ease of access.

- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: 
  - Manages SSL/TLS certificates for the domain to enable HTTPS, providing secure connections for all frontend traffic.
  - The certificate is used by CloudFront and is validated using DNS records in Route 53.

- **Amazon CloudFront**:
  - Serves as the content delivery network (CDN) to improve performance by caching and distributing content globally.
  - Configured with an Origin Access Control (OAC) to securely connect to the S3 bucket for accessing the websiteâ€™s content without making the S3 bucket publicly accessible.

- **Amazon Route 53**:
  - Manages DNS records for the domain and directs traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
  - Used to configure both the root domain and the `www` subdomain for seamless user access.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: For creating a responsive, user-friendly layout and styling of the resume page.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend interactivity, including a counter to display the number of visitors to the site.
- **AWS S3**: Used for hosting the static website, serving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.
- **AWS CloudFront**: Set up as a CDN to improve website performance and provide HTTPS support.
- **Terraform**: For managing the infrastructure as code, including S3, CloudFront, and IAM policies.
- **GitHub Actions**: Configured to automate testing and deployment, ensuring seamless integration and delivery of updates.

## Features

- **Visitor Counter**: Integrated with a backend API to track and display the number of visitors in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **CDN and HTTPS**: CloudFront setup ensures faster content delivery and secure HTTPS access.
